        "Learners should avoid using direct or (particularly) forced choice questions in beginning a line of inquiry because it restricts the possible flow of information and makes obtaining the necessary information a tedious task. Example: if NOT beginning with an open-ended question such as: \"Tell me about the pain.” they must ask several direct questions: L: \"Is the pain an ache?\" P: \"No.\"  L: \"Is it a stabbing pain?\" P: \"No.\"  L: \"Is it a dull pain?\" P: \"No.\"\n",
        "Learners should avoid these poor question types:\n",

        "Example: \"Why didn’t you come in sooner, you've had the problem for six weeks?\"\n",
        "Multiple Questions are a series of short questions asked in succession without allowing the patient to answer each individually. The patient may be confused about which question to answer.\n",
        "Example: “Does the pain feel like it’s as sharp after dinner or is it different than before dinner? Multiple questions may also be one question listing many options. Example: \"Has anyone in your family ever had cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?\"\n",
